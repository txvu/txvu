ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Trinh Vu. \

Computer Science student at University of Central Oklahoma. \
In my spare time, I'm working on my lab that includes several interesting projects. \
I named it 3AM Lab (get it? vampire's active time). The ultimate idea is to automate any boring task that I can think of. \
Hopefully, it will help me and other people save some time to pursue whatever hobby we've been dreaming. \

Happy coding!!!
